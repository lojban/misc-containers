# OK, so this uidmap thing.
#
# First of all, it's specific to the exim container, but it's here rather than
# on the container because uidmaps are a function of the pod; see
# https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12669 .  As to what it's for:
#
# Fedora exim wants to setuid to "93" specifically.  Not the exim
# user's uid, just "93"; it's baked in at build time (this appears
# to be standard for exim, not just Fedora).
#
# The uidmap bits here mean "map 0-92 in the container to 1-93 on the
# host, map 93 in the container to 0 on the host, and map 94-[lots]
# in the container to 95-[lots] on the host", which sounds wacky
# except that per
# https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html , in
# rootless mode "0 on the host" means "the UID of the user", and "1
# on the host" means "the first subuid of the user", and so on.
#
# So the net effect is that UID 93 in the container (the exim user)
# runs as the calling user (spdrata) on the host.
#
# exim *starts* as root, so anything that exim writes out as root
# will go to the wrong uid, but we can't actually fix that, and it
# mostly doesn't seem to do that at all.
#
# The DNS arg is because for some reason the slirp4netns entry in
# resolv.conf, 10.0.2.3, doesn't work with this setup, no idea why.
